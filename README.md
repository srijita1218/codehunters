# Animal Sighting in Rural Areas

This project aims to enhance safety and awareness in rural areas near forest regions by implementing an advanced animal detection and alert system.

## Features

1. **Camera and Sensor Network**: 
   - Deployment of cameras and sensors at elevated heights near forest regions.
   - Cameras capture visual data.
   - Sensors detect audio and infrared signals to capture movement and images of approaching animals.

2. **AI/ML-Powered Identification and Prediction**:
   - Utilizes Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms to:
     - Identify animal species.
     - Predict proximity, speed, and estimated time of arrival based on stored data models.
   - Future plans include incorporating sound and behavioral recognition for more accurate identification.

3. **Alert System**:
   - Notifies both forest officials and local citizens upon animal identification.
   - Ensures safety measures can be taken by both parties.

4. **Real-Time Notifications**:
   - Sends real-time SMS alerts to registered users.
   - Triggers alarm notifications on users' mobile devices.

5. **Historical Tracking and Risk Assessment**:
   - Maintains a database of past animal attacks.
   - Identifies and highlights high-risk regions for increased vigilance.
